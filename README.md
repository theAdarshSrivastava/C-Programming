# Data Structure and Algorithms

Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. 

## Why to Learn Data Structure and Algorithms?
As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days.

- Data Search − Consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower.

- Processor speed − Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.

- Multiple requests − As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.

To solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to rescue. Data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly.

## Characteristics of a Data Structure
- Correctness − Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.

- Time Complexity − Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.

- Space Complexity − Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.
